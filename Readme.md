**⚡ BrandGIF Pro v4.0
The High-Energy Asset Finder for Power Users.
BrandGIF Pro is a raw, fast, and monetized GIF/Asset search engine built with Tailwind CSS 4.0 and the GIPHY API. It features a "Neo-Brutalist" UI—heavy strokes, hard shadows, and high-contrast logic—designed for designers who need assets now.

**🚀 Pro Features
Instant Search: Millions of assets via GIPHY API integration.
Save as PNG: Built-in <canvas> engine to capture and convert GIF frames into static PNGs.
Newsletter Pro Gate: Monetization-ready logic that locks specific high-value categories (#Glitch, #Corporate) behind an email signup.
One-Tap Social Share: Integrated deep-links for X (Twitter), Facebook, and WhatsApp.
Vibe Categories: Pre-set designer "Vibes" for rapid asset discovery.
Neo-Brutalist Dark Mode: Stark, high-contrast inversion for late-night hunting.

**🛠️ Tech Stack
Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.0 Browser Engine
API: GIPHY API
Graphics: HTML5 Canvas (for PNG generation)
Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

🛠️ Troubleshooting
PNG Save Failed: Ensure your browser supports Canvas. The script uses crossOrigin = "anonymous" to handle GIPHY's CDN headers, but some strict firewalls may block the fetch.
Zero Results: Check your GIPHY Dashboard to ensure your key hasn't exceeded its daily rate limit (Beta keys are limited to 100/hr).
Layout Issues: This project requires an active internet connection to pull the Tailwind 4.0 engine via CDN. 

🎨 Monetization Strategy
This Pro version is built to grow your brand and your bank account:
Lead Generation: The Pro Gate collects user emails before allowing access to premium tags.
Affiliate Real Estate: The sidebar is pre-styled for affiliate banners (e.g., Creative Market or Envato).
SaaS Potential: Easily upgrade to a paid model by connecting the Pro Gate to a payment processor like Stripe.
